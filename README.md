# AVL Tree Implementation
An AVL Tree is a self balancing binary search tree with utlizies nodes height to maintain the balance.

# Our Project
This Java Program is an implementation of the AVL Tree algorithm under Option 1 of the Group Program. 
It uses a Node class to make a self balancing search binary tree.
The node class has the standard left and right child, and key value within it, as well as a height variable. Our program uses the height variable to  that is used to calculate the balance of the Tree so it can determine if  one sub-tree outweighs the other. If the trees is unbalanced then our AVL Tree uses a left and/or right rotations to balance the tree.
# Running this program
If you click here>>>[avlTree.zip](https://github.com/lexc24/proj345/files/11197403/avlTree.zip)
This will download the zip file of our Node, AVL, and testing files. Once you have them in the same directory, you can launch the testing file and it will run our tests which checked the main three methods of the BST, search, insert, and deletion. 

If you want to use the AVL tree for your own purposes, important things to keep in mind for our methods are...
