# AVL Tree Implementation
An AVL Tree is a self balancing binary search tree with utlizies nodes height to maintain the balance.

# Our Project
This Java Program is an implementation of the AVL Tree algorithm under Option 1 of the Group Program. 
It uses a Node class to make a self balancing search binary tree.
The node class has the standard left and right child, and key value within it, as well as a height variable. Our program uses the height variable to  that is used to calculate the balance of the Tree so it can determine if  one sub-tree outweighs the other. If the trees is unbalanced then our AVL Tree uses a left and/or right rotations to balance the tree.
# Running this program
In our testing file we had two for loops to test the insertion and deletion of the AVL Tree
To Run this program, either use the given test cases provided in the avlTreeTest.java file or by calling the varius public functions to implement a avlTree object.
