# This Java Program is an Implemntation of the AVL Tree algorithm under Option 1 of the Group Program. 
# It uses a Node class to make a self balancing search binary tree.
# The node class has the standard left and right child, and key value withint it, as well as a height variable that is used to calculate the balance of the Tree so
# that a rotation of unbalanced sections of the tree can be corrected.
# 
#  
# To Run this program, either use the given test cases provided in the avlTreeTest.java file or by calling the varius public functions to implement a avlTree object.
